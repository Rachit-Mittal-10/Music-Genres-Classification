- **Algorithms Used**: SVC, KNN, Decision Trees, Neural Networks(CNN,ANN)
- Part of Music Information Retrieval
- Characteristics of Music: Harmony, Melody, Rhythm, Timbre, Pace
- Several Signal Degrading Factors like Noise and Distortion. Model could be trained to perform even better when there's noise and distortion
- **Objective**: To classify the genres accurately using the Deep Learning Models and develop a trustworthy and reliable model
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix
- **Results**:
    - Audio Clips of 30 seconds in `.wav` format with sample rate of `22.05KHz` and 16 bits resolution.
    - MFCCs are used.
- **Conclusions & Future Enhancements**:
    - All the MFCCs saved as JSON File. It lowers the dimensionality. Here dimensionality is 13.
    - Built in works with `.wav` format. Can employ on other audio format. *Categorisation of audio format within genre*
    - *Data Augmentation* can lead to better accuracy.
